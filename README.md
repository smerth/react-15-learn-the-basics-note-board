# React.js the basics - note-board app



This app is built following the Lynda.com tutorial: [Learn React.js: The Basics](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/Learn-React-js-Basics/379264-2.html)

> This web app allows users to create, update, and delete notes.  The notes can be dragged around the screen. Notes are saved to an array in memory and last as long as the current window is open.
